This is the beginning of the 'file security scan' project. I will be programming this web application in PHP and JavaScript.
The purpose of this project is to be able to upload code files and be provided tips for implementing missing security measures.

Added composer and phpdotenv to securely store database credentials. Created a new class named `Database` for handling database
operations.

Implemented file upload functionalities.
Created a new class named `Uploader` for handling file uploads, along with a new table named `files` for storing upload information.
For uploading a file, a new `Uploader` instance is created in `upload_file.php` which establishes a connection to the database and
uploads file to the `uploads/` directory.

Tried implementing PHPParser with node visitors for traversing an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), looking for words that are required for
correctly implementing prepared statements. This did not work.

Attempting to implement tokens instead (token_get_all()) to do something similar to PHPParser.
